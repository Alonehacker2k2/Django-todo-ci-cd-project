# django-todo
A simple todo app built with django

We just need to start the server now and then we can start using our simple todo App. Start the server by following command

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

Once the server is hosted, head over to http://127.0.0.1:8000/todos for the App.

Cheers and Happy Coding :)
